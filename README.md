An adiabatic waveform generator using black hole perturbation theory

BHPWave generates gravitational waveforms of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) using the adiabatic approximation of black hole perturbation theory. The model is restricted to binaries in which the small body is undergoing a quasi-circular, equatorial inspiral into a rotating massive black hole.
