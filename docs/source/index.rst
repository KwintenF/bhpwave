Welcome to BHPWave's documentation!
===================================

**BHPWave** is a C++ library wrapped in Python that generates gravitational waveforms 
of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) using the adiabatic approximation of black hole 
perturbation theory. The model is restricted to binaries in which the small body is 
undergoing a quasi-circular, equatorial inspiral into a rotating massive black hole.
