bhpwave
===================================

**BHPWave** (or :code:`bhpwave`) is a C++ library wrapped in Python that generates gravitational waveforms 
of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) using the adiabatic approximation of black hole 
perturbation theory and the self-force formalism. The model is restricted to binaries in which the small body is 
undergoing a quasi-circular, equatorial inspiral into a rotating massive black hole.

   This project is under active development.

Installation guidelines and a quick tutorial can be found in the
:doc:`usage` section. Relevant background on the waveform generation model is
outlined in the :doc:`background` section. Additionally, citations and literature references
are provided in the :doc:`ref` section, along with links to related open-source
waveform models. Detailed documentation can be found in the :doc:`api/api` section.
